# Remote-Teaching-Setup

As we get more and more requests of describing our remote teaching setup, we decided to create this repository and provide the setup with costs and links in its [wiki pages](https://github.com/spethso/Remote-Teaching-Setup/wiki). 

Please note, that we will update the wiki during the upcoming weeks.
